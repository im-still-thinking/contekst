## Project Overview

Our project is dedicated to providing users with a secure and decentralized platform for storing llm context and memories. By leveraging Walrus, we ensure that all data is stored in a decentralized and encrypted manner, enhancing both security and accessibility.

## Introduction to Walrus

Walrus is an innovative decentralized storage network designed to offer scalable, reliable, and programmable data storage solutions. It enables users to publish, deliver, and manage data on-chain efficiently. Key features of Walrus include:

- **Cost-Effective Storage**: Store large volumes of data at reasonable costs.
- **High Reliability**: Access data anytime and anywhere with consistent reliability.
- **High Performance**: Achieve fast read and write operations suitable for various applications.
- **Programmable Storage**: Manage storage resources with capabilities like buying, trading, and versioning.

## How Walrus Works

Walrus utilizes advanced distributed storage technology to ensure data integrity and availability:

1. **Data Encoding and Distribution**: User data is encoded into smaller fragments called "slivers" using Walrus's RedStuff algorithm. These slivers are then distributed across a network of storage nodes, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.

2. **Proof-of-Availability (PoA)**: Once the data is distributed, a PoA certificate is generated and published on the Sui blockchain. This certificate serves as verifiable proof that the data is securely stored and available.

3. **Data Retrieval**: When users request their stored data, the system retrieves the necessary slivers from the storage nodes and reconstructs the original data using the RedStuff decoding algorithm.

## Utilizing Walrus in Contekst

In our Contekst project, we utilize Walrus to store user images and memory data securely. The integration process involves:

### Memory Data Storage
- **Intent-based Memory Storage**: User intents, facts, and summaries are encrypted and stored using Walrus's distributed storage system
- **Cross-LLM Compatibility**: Memory data remains accessible across different LLM platforms through Walrus's consistent storage layer
- **Semantic Search Data**: Vector embeddings and search indices are stored securely on Walrus for fast retrieval

### Image Storage
- **Personal Memories**: User-uploaded images and visual memories are encrypted and distributed across Walrus nodes
- **Metadata Storage**: Image metadata, tags, and associations are stored alongside the actual image data
- **Version Control**: Walrus enables versioning of images and memory data, allowing users to track changes over time

### Integration Architecture

```
User Data → Encryption → Walrus Encoding → Distributed Storage → PoA Certificate → Sui Blockchain
     ↓
Memory Retrieval ← Decryption ← Walrus Decoding ← Sliver Reconstruction ← Storage Nodes
```

## Benefits of Using Walrus in Contekst
